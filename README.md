<h1>DETECTWAVE - SCENARIO RECOGNITION FROM IMAGE</h1>
<br>
<p>Our system is designed to detect and recognize objects and scenes in images. Users can upload an image, and the system will automatically identify objects within the image and the overall scene it represents. It uses a sophisticated model, Faster R-CNN, which efficiently processes images to pinpoint objects and their categories. The system also recognizes scenes such as gardens, parks, and more, providing context to the detected objects. The results are presented in a clear and concise format, making it accessible for users to understand the content of their images. Whether for image classification or scene recognition, this system simplifies the process, making it useful for a range of applications from content tagging to automated image analysis.

<p>Our system is an intuitive and efficient tool that enhances image understanding by automatically identifying objects and scenes within uploaded images. Powered by the advanced Faster R-CNN model, it excels at the precise detection and classification of objects, ranging from trees and flowers to garden tools and furniture commonly found in garden settings. Beyond object recognition, the system provides valuable context by recognizing scenes, such as gardens, parks, and specific garden-related activities. This dual capability empowers users to not only comprehend the contents of their images but also the broader context in which these objects exist. The results are presented in an accessible and informative format, making it valuable for tasks like content tagging, automated image organization, and aiding those with visual impairments in interpreting images. Whether for personal use or professional applications, our system simplifies the process of gaining insights from images, offering a versatile and user-friendly solution for a wide range of image-related tasks.
