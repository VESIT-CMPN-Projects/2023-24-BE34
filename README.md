<h1>DETECTWAVE - SCENARIO RECOGNITION FROM IMAGE</h1>
<br>
<p>Our system is designed to detect and recognize objects and scenes in images. Users can upload an image, and the system will automatically identify objects within the image and the overall scene it represents. It uses a sophisticated model, Faster R-CNN, which efficiently processes images to pinpoint objects and their categories. The system also recognizes scenes such as gardens, parks, and more, providing context to the detected objects. The results are presented in a clear and concise format, making it accessible for users to understand the content of their images. Whether for image classification or scene recognition, this system simplifies the process, making it useful for a range of applications from content tagging to automated image analysis.
